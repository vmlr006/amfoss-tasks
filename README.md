I am Vimal and I'm from Malappuram,Kerala.My hhobbies are reading and photography.
I think that amFoss club is good for me becauseones i learn something and it feels interesting to me, I don't really mind spending whatever time on it. I'm a student from bio background and I'm new to the world of coding. But so far I'm loving everything I'm learning and i wish to apply it practically.
I will contribute back to the club by working to my extream limits.
I'm really fascinated the technology that is around us. So I wish to learn about them and about how they work. That is the key reason why i chose CSE and I think the club can really help me with that.
I'm also looking for a good mentorship. And from what I've heard amFoss provides excelent mentorship as well.
